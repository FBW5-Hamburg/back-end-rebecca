# Nodejs/mongoose backend project

Nodejs is designed to build scalable network applications and it is also a open source server environment which could be run on various platforms.
while Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful.

### Why use mongoose and Nodejs:

MongoDB and Node.js are often used together because of their shared use of JavaScript and its object notation (JSON).

## Description
In this project am able to create a full-stack back-end file for an online vegetable  store. Which enable the admin to add, edit and remove respectively based on whatever need is require... and using Mongoose as a means of storing Data.

## Road-map
In future i would like to make this project much more functional and work more on my edit file, because there are other ideas on how to make it function well
